#  SweatSketch: Sketch, Sweat, and Succeed
The SweatSketch: Sketch, Sweat, and Succeed is a lightweight app for taking gym notes about workout programs and weight-lifting results.

This service is a companion for the iOS application written on Kotlin as a milestone in my journey to Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) development.

The service ensures user security using JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens.

Don’t forget to add the following parameters on startup:

> -P:jwt.secret=“secret_string”
> 
> -P:jwt.refreshSecret=“refresh_secret_string"
