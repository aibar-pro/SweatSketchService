#  SweatSketch: Service
The SweatSketch: Sketch, Sweat, and Succeed is a lightweight app for taking gym notes about workout programs and weight-lifting results.

This service is a companion for the iOS application written on Kotlin as a milestone in my journey to fullstack development.

The service ensures user security using JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens.

Don’t forget to add the following parameters on startup:

> -P:jwt.secret=“secret_string”
> 
> -P:jwt.refreshSecret=“refresh_secret_string"
